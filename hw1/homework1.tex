{\Large Homework 1: Regression}\\
\end{center}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This homework is on different forms of linear regression and focuses
on loss functions, optimizers, and regularization. Linear regression
will be one of the few models that we see that has an analytical
solution.  These problems focus on deriving these solutions and
exploring their properties.

If you find that you are having trouble with the first couple
problems, we recommend going over the fundamentals of linear algebra
and matrix calculus (see links on website).  The relevant parts of the
\href{https://github.com/harvard-ml-courses/cs181-textbook/blob/master/Textbook.pdf}{cs181-textbook notes are Sections 2.1 - 2.7}.  We strongly recommend
reading the textbook before beginning the homework.

    We also encourage you to first read the \href{http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop\%20-\%20Pattern\%20Recognition\%20And\%20Machine\%20Learning\%20-\%20Springer\%20\%202006.pdf}{Bishop textbook}, particularly:
Section 2.3 (Properties of Gaussian Distributions), Section 3.1
(Linear Basis Regression), and Section 3.3 (Bayesian Linear
Regression). (Note that our notation is slightly different but the
underlying mathematics remains the same!).

\textbf{Please type your solutions after the corresponding problems using this
\LaTeX\ template, and start each problem on a new page.} You may find
the following introductory resources on \LaTeX\ useful:

\begin{problem}[Optimizing a Kernel, 15pts]

Kernel-based regression techniques are similar to nearest-neighbor
regressors: rather than fit a parametric model, they predict values
for new data points by interpolating values from existing points in
the training set.  In this problem, we will consider a kernel-based
regressor of the form:
\begin{equation*}
  f(x^*) = \frac{ \sum_{n} K(x_n,x^*) y_n  }{ \sum_{n} K(x_n,x^*) } 
\end{equation*}
where $(x_n,y_n)$ are the training data points, and $K(x,x')$ is a
kernel function that defines the similarity between two inputs $x$ and
$x'$. Assume that each $x_i$ is represented as a column vector, i.e. a
$D$ by 1 vector where $D$ is the number of features for each data
point. A popular choice of kernel is a function that decays as the
distance between the two points increases, such as
\begin{equation*}
  K(x,x') = \exp(-||x-x'||^2_2) = \exp(-(x-x')^T (x-x') ) 
\end{equation*} 
However, the squared Euclidean distance $||x-x'||^2_2$ may not always
be the right choice.  In this problem, we will consider optimizing
over squared Mahalanobis distances
\begin{equation*}
  K(x,x') = \exp(-(x-x')^T W (x-x') )
  \label{eqn:distance}
\end{equation*} 
where $W$ is a symmetric $D$ by $D$ matrix.  Intuitively, introducing
the weight matrix $W$ allows for different dimensions to matter
differently when defining similarity.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $\{(x_n,y_n)\}_{n=1}^N$ be our training data set.  Suppose
  we are interested in minimizing the residual sum of squares.  Write down this
  loss over the training data $\mcL(W)$ as a function of $W$.

  Important: When computing the prediction $f(x_i)$ for a point $x_i$
  in the training set, carefully consider for which points $x'$ you should be including
  the term $K(x_i,x')$ in the sum.
  
\item In the following, let us assume that $D = 2$.  That means that
  $W$ has three parameters: $W_{11}$, $W_{22}$, and $W_{12} = W_{21}$.
  Expand the formula for the loss function to be a function of these
  three parameters.
  
 \item Derive the gradients of the loss function with respect to each of the parameters of $W$ for the $D=2$ case. (This will look a bit messy!)



\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{framed}
\noindent\textbf{Problem 1} (cont.)\\
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item Consider the following data set:
\begin{csv}
x1 , x2 , y 
  0 , 0 , 0
  0 , .5 , 0
  0 , 1 , 0 
  .5 , 0 , .5
  .5 , .5 , .5
  .5 , 1 , .5
  1 , 0 , 1
  1 , .5 , 1
  1 , 1 , 1 
\end{csv}
And the following kernels:
\begin{equation*} 
W_1 = \alpha \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
W_2 = \alpha \begin{bmatrix}
  0.1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
W_3 = \alpha \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0.1 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*} 
with $\alpha = 10$. Write some Python code to compute the loss with
respect to each kernel for the dataset provided above. Which kernel
does best?  Why?  How does the choice of $\alpha$ affect the loss? 

For this problem, you can use our staff \textbf{script to compare your code to a set of staff-written test cases.} This requires, however, that you use the structure of the starter code provided in \texttt{T1\_P1.py}. More specific instructions can be found at the top of the file \texttt{T1\_P1\_Testcases.py}. You may run the test cases in the command-line using \texttt{python T1\_P1\_TestCases.py}.
\textbf{Note that our set of test cases is not comprehensive: just because you pass does not mean your solution is correct! We strongly encourage you to write your own test cases and read more about ours in the comments of the Python script.}

\item Bonus:  Code up a gradient descent to
  optimize the kernel for the data set above.  Start your gradient
  descent from $W_1$.  Report on what you find.\\
  Gradient descent is discussed in Section 3.4 of the cs181-textbook notes and Section 5.2.4 of Bishop, and will be covered later in the course!

\begin{problem}[Kernels and kNN, 10pts]

Now, let us compare the kernel-based approach to an approach based on
nearest-neighbors.  Recall that kNN uses a predictor of the form

  \begin{equation*}
    f(x^*) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_n y_n \mathbb{I}(x_n \texttt{ is one of k-closest to } x^*)
  \end{equation*}

\noindent where $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator variable. For this problem, you will use the same kernels as Problem 1, and dataset \verb|data/p2.csv|. 

For this problem, you can use our staff \textbf{script to compare your code to a set of staff-written test cases.} This requires, however, that you use the structure of the starter code provided in \texttt{T1\_P2.py}. More specific instructions can be found at the top of the file \texttt{T1\_P2\_Testcases.py}. You may run the test cases in the command-line using \texttt{python T1\_P2\_TestCases.py}.
\textbf{Note that our set of test cases is not comprehensive: just because you pass does not mean your solution is correct! We strongly encourage you to write your own test cases and read more about ours in the comments of the Python script.}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}


\begin{enumerate}

\item We will be making 6 plots comparing kernel-based and nearest
  neighbor-based predictors, all using the Mahalanobis distance
  corresponding to $W_1$ from Problem 1. In each plot, you will plot
  the predicted value of $y$, given $x_1$ (horizontal axis) and $x_2$
  (vertical axis), as the color of each point (grayscale
  between $0$ and $1$). Include the $x_1$ and $x_2$ axes, with tick marks spaced every 0.1 units
  for $x_1=0$ to $x_1=1$ and $x_2=0$ to $x_2=1$.
  
  For the first three plots, use the kernel-based predictor varying
  $\alpha = \{0.1,3,10\}$.  For the next three plots, use the kNN
  predictor with $\alpha = 1$, $k=\{1,5,N-1\}$, where $N$ is the size
  of the data set.

  Print the total least squares loss on the training set for each of
  the 6 plots.
  
  You may choose to use some starter Python code to create your plots
  provided in \verb|T1_P2.py|.  Please \textbf{write your own
    implementation of kNN} for full credit.  Do not use external
  libraries to find nearest neighbors.
  
\item Do any of the kernel-based regression plots look like the 1NN?
  The $(N-1)$NN?  Why or why not?

\item Suppose we are given some $W$ for a Mahalanobis distance or
  kernel function.  Then, in general, there exist values of $k$ for which
  kernel-based regression and kNN disagree (i.e., make different predictions)
  on at least one input - for all choices of $\alpha$. Explain why by means of
  an example (i.e., show that for some value $k$ of your choosing,
  no value of $\alpha$ will produce two classifiers that are the same).
    
\item Why did we not vary $\alpha$ for the kNN approach?    

\end{enumerate}

% Problem 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}[Deriving Linear Regression, 10pts]

  In class, we noted that the solution for the least squares linear
  regressions ``looked'' like a ratio of covariance and variance
  terms.  In this problem, we will make that connection more explicit.

  Let us assume that our data are tuples of scalars $(x,y)$ that come from
  some distribution $p(x,y)$.  We will consider the process of fitting
  these data with the best linear model possible, that is a linear
  model of the form $\hat{y} = wx$ that minimizes the expected squared
  loss $E_{x,y}[ ( y - \hat{y} )^2 ]$.\\

\noindent \emph{Notes:} The notation $E_{x, y}$ indicates an
expectation taken over the joint distribution $p(x,y)$.  Since $x$ and
$y$ are scalars, $w$ is also a scalar.
  
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Derive an expression for the optimal $w$, that is, the $w$
    that minimizes the expected squared loss above.  You should leave
    your answer in terms of moments of the data, e.g. terms like
    $E_x[x]$, $E_x[x^2]$, $E_y[y]$, $E_y[y^2]$, $E_{x,y}[xy]$ etc.

\item Provide unbiased and consistent formulas to estimate $E_{x, y}[yx]$
 and $E_x[x^2]$ given observed data $\{(x_n,y_n)\}_{n=1}^N$.

\item In general, moment terms like $E_{x, y}[yx]$, $E_{x, y}[x^2]$,
  etc. can easily be estimated from the data (like you did above).  If
  you substitute in these empirical moments, how does your expression
  for the optimal $w^*$ in this problem compare with the optimal $w^*$
  that we derived in class/Section 2.6 of the cs181-textbook?

\item As discussed in lecture, many common probabilistic linear regression models assume that variables x and y are jointly Gaussian.  Did any of your above derivations rely on the assumption that x and y are jointly Gaussian?  Why or why not?
    
\end{enumerate}

% Problem 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}[Modeling Changes in Republicans and Sunspots, 15pts]
  
 The objective of this problem is to learn about linear regression
 with basis functions by modeling the number of Republicans in the
 Senate. The file \verb|data/year-sunspots-republicans.csv| contains the
 data you will use for this problem.  It has three columns.  The first
 one is an integer that indicates the year.  The second is the number
 of Sunspots observed in that year.  The third is the number of Republicans in the Senate for that year.
 The data file looks like this:
 \begin{csv}
Year,Sunspot_Count,Republican_Count
1960,112.3,36
1962,37.6,34
1964,10.2,32
1966,47.0,36
\end{csv}

You can see scatterplots of the data in the figures below.  The horizontal axis is the Year, and the vertical axis is the Number of Republicans and the Number of Sunspots, respectively.

\vspace{-5mm}


\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent\emph{Make sure to include all required plots in your PDF.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item In this problem you will implement ordinary least squares regression using 4 different basis functions for
\textbf{Year (x-axis)} v. \textbf{Number of Republicans in the Senate (y-axis)}. Some starter Python code
that implements simple linear regression is provided in \verb|T1_P4.py|.

First, plot the data and regression lines for each of the following sets of basis functions, and include
the generated plot as an image in your submission PDF. You will therefore make 4 total plots:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] $\phi_j(x) = x^j$ for $j=1, \ldots, 5$\\
    ie, use basis $y = a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5$ for some constants $\{a_1, ..., a_5\}$. 
    \item[(b)] $\phi_j(x) = \exp{\frac{-(x-\mu_j)^2}{25}}$ for $\mu_j=1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, \ldots 2010$
	\item[(c)] $\phi_j(x) = \cos(x / j)$ for $j=1, \ldots, 5$
	\item[(d)] $\phi_j(x) = \cos(x / j)$ for $j=1, \ldots, 25$
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-2mm}
{\footnotesize * Note: Be sure to add a bias term for each of the basis functions above.}

Second, for each plot include the residual sum of squares error. Submit the generated plot and residual sum-of-squares error for each basis in your LaTeX write-up.
\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\begin{framed}
\noindent\textbf{Problem 4} (cont.)\\
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Repeat the same exact process as above but for \textbf{Number of Sunspots (x-axis)} v. \textbf{Number of Republicans in the Senate (y-axis)}. 
Now, however, only use data from before 1985, and only use basis functions (a), (c), and (d) -- ignore basis (b). You will therefore make 3 total plots. For each plot make sure to also include the residual sum of squares error.

Which of the three bases (a, c, d) provided the "best" fit? \textbf{Choose one}, and keep in mind the generalizability of the model. 

Given the quality of this fit, do you believe that the number of sunspots controls the number of Republicans in the senate (Yes or No)?
\end{enumerate}
