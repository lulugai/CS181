Some things you can explore are adding or removing layers, changing the number of nodes at each layer, or experimenting with convolutional and pooling layers (see Appendix). The only requirement is that your model attain at least 50% test set accuracy after training for 10 epochs.  This part of the problem is intentionally open-ended, and we encourage you to explore!\n","\n","For your new neural network, include a plot of train and test set loss in your writeup.  Calculate your model's train/test accuracy and precision/recall for the 10 classes.\n","\n","In your writeup, copy and paste your modified neural network class and describe the architectural changes you made.
